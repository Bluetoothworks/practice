1. Make a contribution to your own repo

open folder
git init     (makes .git file in folder)
git add .   (adds all the folder content to stage)
git commit -m "hello" 
git remote add origin https://github.com/Bluetoothworks/First-proj.git
git push -u origin master (pushed to master)


2. To make a branch and push to the branch, not the master

git init(no need to do this if done already)
git checkout -b branch1  (a new branch named branch1 is created)
git add .
git commit -m "added"
git push -u origin branch1 (pushed to branch 1)

3. To merge an unpushed branch to the master(a pushed branch can be merged as well)

git checkout master (given that branch is is declared and changes are commited)
git merge branch1 (changes in branch 1 are added to master)
git push -u origin master (the new merged master is pushed to be added)

4. if there are 2 changes merged before pushing after the first, merge conflic occurs, this gives 3 options, either add both, or add the current or the incoming
